Here is an example with shared overlay structure. To copy an overlay from one coarse mesh to another, the CM type data card block need to be modified as follows:

A regular CM type block of z-level input file may look like:

/ cm type, each cm (<0 =look for overlay)
1 1  1  1  1
1 -1 1  1  1
1 1  1  1  1
1 1  1  1  1
1 1  1  1  1

To copy the CM 7 overlay to other coarse meshes, it can be done like this:

/ cm type, each cm (<0 =look for overlay)
1 1   1  1  1
1 -1 71  71  1
1 1  71  1  1
1 1  1  1  1
1 1  1  1  1

with the rest of input file remains the same. But now the coarse mesh 7 overlay structure will be also used for CM 8, 9 and 13, which are indicated by their corresponding "71" CM type number.
Here, the first digit '7' is the coarse mesh number whose overlay will be copied. '1' is coarse mesh type as usual.

More than one coarse mesh overlay can be shared, for example

/ cm type, each cm (<0 =look for overlay)
1     1   1  1  1
1     1   1  1  1
-1   -1   1  1  1
111  121  1  1  1
1     1   1  1  1

In this case, CM16 shares an overlay with CM11, and CM17 shares one with CM12.

Note:
1. Only the cm type card input need to be modified, the rest input cards should remain same. The overlay structure indicated by a negative CM type number can be specified as usual.
2. for now, it only works when copying an overlay structure from a previously defined coarse mesh. The following won't work:

/ cm type, each cm (<0 =look for overlay)
1     1   1  1  1
1     1   1  1  1
-1   171   1  1  1
111  -1  1  1  1
1     1   1  1  1

CM12 tries to use CM17 overlay, which hasn't be read in yet. It would fail.

Copying from previously copied CM would work:

/ cm type, each cm (<0 =look for overlay)
1     1   1  1  1
1     1   1  1  1
-1   111   1  1  1
111  121  1  1  1
1     1   1  1  1

In this case, CM17 copies from CM12, which itself copies from CM11. So this would be the same as

/ cm type, each cm (<0 =look for overlay)
1     1   1  1  1
1     1   1  1  1
-1   111  1  1  1
111  111  1  1  1
1     1   1  1  1
